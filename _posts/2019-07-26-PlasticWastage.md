## Executive Summary 
At a global scale, we can see how plastic density has increased in the last decades. Though we may be aware of it, we have yet to understand the implications of our daily plastic consumption and how our country contributed to this "plastic pandemic." Now, we are presenting a pitch deck to encourage Filipinos, especially the youth who are active change agent in this millennial regime, to acknowledge; step up; and promote avoiding plastic so that our nation can aide in improving instead of degrading our waters. By presenting relevant statistics that targets Philippine Audience, we emphasize that plastic-less society is the way to go.
