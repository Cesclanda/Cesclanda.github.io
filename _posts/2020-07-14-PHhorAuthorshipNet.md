## Executive Summary 
Congressmen and bills for the 17th and 18th sessions of the Philippine House of Representatives were obtained from the Legislative Information System (http://www.congress.gov.ph/legis). From this, a weighted and undirected bill co-authorship network was constructed, wherein the nodes are the congressmen. An edge connects two congressmen if they coauthored at least one bill, with the edge weight representing the number of bills coauthored. It is found that the legislative influence and success of a congressman can be approximated by his betweenness centrality.
